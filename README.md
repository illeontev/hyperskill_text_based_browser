# hyperskill_text_based_browser
The very primitive program that allows you to browse the Internet

You should use the command line to work with it.

The only argument is the folder for creating files with internet content.

You input the name if the site in the program and get is's content - that's all.

You can print "back" to view the previous page.

You can print "exit" if you'd like to close the program.
